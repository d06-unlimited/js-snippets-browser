Create an API with zero code using 
package json server.

Start the API on a terminal:
npm run api
(see the section "scripts" in the package.json file:
there you find what "npm run api" really does
)

On a second terminal start the HTML DOM project
with liveserver. And train some fetch against your fancy API.

Enjoy buddy!
